# Building A Handwritten Digit Classifier
In this project I designed and implemented a handwritten digit classifier using a variety of machine learning models and concepts. My goals for this project were the following:
 * to explore why image classification is difficult
 * to observe the limitations of traditional machine learning models for image classification
 * to train, test, and improve a few different deep neural networks for image classification

## My Process
1. Import and Explore Data
2. Train & Test K-Nearest Neighbors
    - Vary number of neighbors
    - Implement Cross-Validation
4. Train & Test Neural Networks
    - Vary number of neurons & layers
    - Implement Cross-Validation
6. Explore Other Methods
    - Decision Tree Classifiers
    - Random Forest Classifiers
7. Visualize Weights

## Results
We achieved fairly high accuracies with our models. It's a bit difficult to understand how to interpret some of our results, as they all achieved fairly high accuracies. Further steps could include more visualizations in this area.

## Lessons Learned
Image classification is **HARD**. It's very easy to see the limitations of some models, while also recognizing the advantages of others. Getting to visualize the weights of our neural networks was also very difficult (and honestly, quite confusing). It can be extremely difficult to understand what neural networks are doing, and more importantly, *why* they are doing them.
